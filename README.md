## Introduction
Welcome to the License Plate Detection Software! Crafted by **Abdullah Alshateri** and **Ahmed Balfiqah**, a third-year Electronic-Telecom Engineering students from UTM.

Harnessing the raw power of the Ultralytics YOLO model, our software can detect license plates in split-second timing using the ESP32-CAM. But it doesn't stop there! With advanced machine learning algorithms, the software dives deep into each detection, deciphering even the tiniest nuances of a license plate. Whatâ€™s more, it seamlessly integrates these detections into an Excel database, ensuring that data archival is not just efficient but also organized.

Whether you're an enthusiast looking for a reliable license plate recognition solution or a professional seeking robust software for larger systems, our tool is designed to impress and deliver. Dive in and discover our license plate detector!
